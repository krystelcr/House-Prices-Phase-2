# House-Prices-Phase-2

This project develops machine learning models using regression techniques to predict home prices in Ames, Iowa based on 79 housing features from the Ames Housing Dataset compiled by Dean De Cock dataset. The analysis demonstrates how factors beyond typical considerations significantly influence housing prices. The task is to accurately forecast the SalePrice for each house in the test dataset.

### Project Pipeline

###### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses
- Create visualizations to understand feature relationships
- Examine data distributions, target variable patterns, and identify potential issues

###### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values through imputation or/and removal
- Remove unnecessary columns and features with strong collinearity
- Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features
- Save cleaned dataset for modeling

###### Model Development and Tuning
- Create train-test splits
- Implement regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
- Re-train models with optimized parameters

###### Model Evaluation and Selection
- Evaluate performance using RMSE, RÂ², and MAE metrics
- Compare models and select best performer

###### Prediction Generation
- Apply final model to test dataset
- Generate housing price predictions

### Tools

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebooks
- MatplotLib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas 
- Numpy
